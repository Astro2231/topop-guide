# Topology Optimization Guide
This guide is meant to be a step-by-step(ish) description of the general process that was used to design the front and rear wing mounts on fb25. 
My goal while writing this is to make it as generalized as possible so it can be applied to design applications outside of just aero wing mounts. 
The workflow is definitely not optimized either, so I encourage people to look for ways to potentially improve it. 

## Step One: Defining your support points
Before you begin designing your part, you first need to determine what the part is actually going to attach to. Using the rear wing as an example, we clearly need to design the mount to 
span from the two attachment points on the wing to the two brackets on the roll hoop.
